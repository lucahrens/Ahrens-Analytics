# Ahrens-Analytics
This website is designed to recognize patterns in equities to assist retail investors to make their trading decisions. As of now when a ticker symbol is entered on the Search page the stock is analyzed to see if there has been a golden or death cross in the past seven trading days. On the Featured page all of the stocks on the S&P 500 are analyzed to identify these patterns. The vision for this product is to add more recognizable patterns and to allow users to save stocks in a watch list. To see the website in action please visit:
